tutorial.py:  code from introduction section of documentation.
json_att.py:  shows to to use json to serialize python objects, save them as
              netcdf attributes, and then convert them back to python objects.
reading_netcdf.ipynb,writing_netcdf.ipynb: ipython notebooks from Unidata python workshop
threaded_read.py:  test script for concurrent threaded reads.
bench.py:  benchmarks for reading/writing using different formats.
bench_compress*py: benchmarks for reading/writing with compression.
bench_diskless.py: benchmarks for 'diskless' IO.
test_stringarr.py: test utilities for converting arrays of fixed-length strings
                   to arrays of characters (with an extra dimension), and vice-versa.
                   Useful since netcdf does not have a datatype for fixed-length string 
                   arrays.
